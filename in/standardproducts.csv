Morris, one of the most enduringly popular designers of the Arts &amp; Crafts
Movement. A practising architect, Voysey also designed a broad range of applied
arts objects, from furniture, ceramics, and metalwork to wallpaper, carpets,
tiles, and fabrics. His pattern designs, created from the 1880s to the early
1930s, are among his best-known works today. His wallpaper and textile designs
are characterized by simple, stylized, rhythmic patterns that base their motifs
on forms found in the natural world. Plants abound, but so too do birds and
animals, represented as silhouettes or in soft pastel shades. This elegant,
accessibly priced volume offers a wealth of colourful designs by Voysey in
which birds and animals are the principal motifs. Written by Karen Livingstone,
a published expert on Voysey and the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, this book
